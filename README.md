# opis-scraper-manager-2020

This project aims to scrape data from the new __constantly changing__ opis web site, in order to provide data to the [opis manager](https://github.com/UNICT-DMI/OPIS-Manager). It is written in Node.js (I wanted to learn something new ðŸ˜‚).
**DISCLAIMER:** I've just started learning js, so you might cringe yourself seeing how badly things might have been implemented.

* **Clone this repository**
* **Install npm**
